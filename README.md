# JS Fundamentals Activity

An activity to practice expressing code concepts we know from Python in JavaScript, to accompany the Learning Another Language lesson.

## One-Time Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

## Running the Activity

1. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the activity.

  - In the terminal from the project directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ node src/index.js
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```

  - Or from VS Code, install the **Code Runner** extension and run the file by clicking the play button in the top right corner of the editor.

## Syntax Warnings

The project is configured to use ESLint to provide syntax warnings. ESLint can be run from the project directory using the following command:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

ESLint warnings can be shown in VS Code by installing the **ESLint** extension.

## Activity Directions

Examine the commented Python code in `src/index.js` and write equivalent JavaScript code to accomplish the same tasks.
